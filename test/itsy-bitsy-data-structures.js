 *
 * Yeah, they definitely aren't the juiciest topic out there, but they are

 * better programmer.
 *
 * Knowing your data structures can help you:
 *
 *   - Manage complexity and make your programs easier to follow.
 *   - Build high-performance, memory-efficient programs.
 *
 * I believe that the former is more important. Using the right 
 * data structure can drastically simplify what would otherwise 
 * be complicated logic.
 *
 * The latter is important too. If performance or memory matters then
 * using the right data structure is more than often essential.
 *
 * In order to learn about data structures, we're going to implement a few of
 * them together. Don't worry, we'll keep the code nice and short. In fact,
 * there are way more comments than there is code.

/**
 * Algorithm is a fancy name for step-by-step sets of operations to be
 * performed.
 *
 * Data structures are implemented with algorithms, and algorithms are
 * implemented with data structures. It's data structures and algorithms all
 * the way down until you reach the microscopic people with punch cards that
 * control the computer. (That's how computers work right?)
 *
 * Any given task can be implemented in an infinite number of ways. So for
 * common tasks there are often many different algorithms that people have come up
 * with.
 *
 * For example, there are an absurd number of algorithms for sorting a set of
 * unordered items:
 *
 *     Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, Heap Sort,
 *     Quick Sort, Shell Sort, Timsort, Bucket Sort, Radix Sort, ...
 *
 * Some of these are significantly faster than others. Some use less memory.
 * Some are easy to implement. Some are based on assumptions about the dataset.
 *
 * Every single one of them will be better for *something*. So you'll need to
 * make a decision based on what your needs are and for that, you'll need a way
 * of comparing them, a way to measure them.
 *
 * When we compare the performance of algorithms we use a rough measurement of
 * their average and worst-case performance using something called "Big-O".

/**
 * Big-O Notation is a way of roughly measuring the performance of algorithms
 * in order to compare one against another when discussing them.
 *
 * Big-O is a mathematical notation that we borrowed in computer science to
 * classify algorithms by how they respond to the number (N) of items that you
 * give them.
 *
 * There are two primary things that you measure with Big-O:
 *
 * - **Time complexity** refers to the total count of operations an algorithm
 *   will perform given a set of items.
 *
 * - **Space complexity** refers to the total memory an algorithm will take up
 *   while running given a set of items.
 *
 * We measure these independently from one another because while an algorithm
 * may perform fewer operations than another, it may also take up way more
 * memory. Depending on what your requirements are, one may be a better choice
 * than the other.
 *
 * These are some common Big-O's:
 *
 *     Name           Notation     How you feel when they show up at your party
 *     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *     Constant       O(1)         AWESOME!!
 *     Logarithmic    O(log N)     GREAT!
 *     Linear         O(N)         OKAY.
 *     Linearithmic   O(N log N)   UGH...
 *     Polynomial     O(N ^ 2)     SHITTY
 *     Exponential    O(2 ^ N)     HORRIBLE
 *     Factorial      O(N!)        WTF
 *
 * To give you an idea of how many operations we're talking about. Let's look
 * at what these would equal given the (N) number of items.
 *
 *                N = 5            10             20             30
 *     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *     O(1)           1            1              1              1
 *     O(log N)       2.3219...    3.3219...      4.3219...      4.9068...
 *     O(N)           5            10             20             30
 *     O(N log N)     11.609...    33.219...      84.638...      147.204...
 *     O(N ^ 2)       25           100            400            900
 *     O(2 ^ N)       32           1024           1,048,576      1,073,741,824
 *     O(N!)          120          3,628,800      2,432,902,0... 265,252,859,812,191,058,636,308,480,000,000
 *
 * As you can see, even for relatively small sets of data you could do 
 * a **lot** of extra work.
 *
 * With data structures, you can perform 4 primary types of actions:
 * Accessing, Searching, Inserting, and Deleting.
 *
 * It is important to note that data structures may be good at one action but
 * bad at another.
 *
 *                            Accessing    Searching    Inserting    Deleting
 *    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *                  Array     O(1)         O(N)         O(N)         O(N)
 *            Linked List     O(N)         O(N)         O(1)         O(1)
 *     Binary Search Tree     O(log N)     O(log N)     O(log N)     O(log N)
 *
 * Or rather...
 *
 *                            Accessing    Searching    Inserting    Deleting
 *    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *                  Array     AWESOME!!    OKAY         OKAY         OKAY
 *            Linked List     OKAY         OKAY         AWESOME!!    AWESOME!!
 *     Binary Search Tree     GREAT!       GREAT!       GREAT!       GREAT!
 *
 * Even further, some actions will have a different "average" performance and a
 * "worst case scenario" performance.
 *
 * There is no perfect data structure, and you choose one over another based on
 * the data that you are working with and the things you are going to do with
 * it. This is why it is important to know a number of different common data
 * structures so that you can choose from them.

/**
 * A computer's memory is pretty boring, it's just a bunch of ordered slots
 * where you can store information. You hold onto memory addresses in order to
 * find information.
 *
 * Let's imagine a chunk of memory like this:
 *
 *      Values: |1001|0110|1000|0100|0101|1010|0010|0001|1101|1011...
 *   Addresses: 0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    ...
 *
 * If you've ever wondered why things are zero-indexed in programming languages
 * before, it is because of the way that memory works. If you want to read the
 * first chunk of memory you read from 0 to 1, the second you read from 1 to 2.
 * So the address that you hold onto for each of those is 0 and 1 respectively.
 *
 * Your computer has much much more memory than this, and it is all just a
 * continuation of the pattern above.
 *

 *
 * If you can draw a loop between connected nodes in a tree... well, you don't

 *
 * Trees have many different uses, they can be used to optimize searching or

/**
 * Binary search trees are a fairly common form of tree for their ability to
 * efficiently access, search, insert, and delete values all while keeping them
 * in a sorted order.
 *
 * Imagine taking a sequence of numbers:
 *
 *     1  2  3  4  5  6  7
 *
 * And turning it into a tree starting from the center.
 *
 *              4
 *           /     \
 *        2           6
 *      /   \       /   \
 *     1     3     5     7
 *    -^--^--^--^--^--^--^-
 *     1  2  3  4  5  6  7
 *
 * This is how a binary tree works. Each node can have two children:
 *
 *     - Left: Less than parent node's value.
 *     - Right: Greater than parent node's value.
 *
 * > Note: In order to make this work all values must be unique in the tree.
 *
 * This makes the traversal to find a value very efficient. Say we're trying to
 * find the number 5 in our tree:
 *
 *             (4)         <--- 5 > 4, so move right.
 *           /     \
 *        2         (6)    <--- 5 < 6, so move left.
 *      /   \       /   \
 *     1     3    (5)    7 <--- We've reached 5!
 *
 * Notice how we only had to do 3 checks to reach the number 5. If we were to
 * expand this tree to 1000 items. We'd go:
 *
 *   500 -> 250 -> 125 -> 62 -> 31 -> 15 -> 7 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
 *
 * Only 10 checks for 1000 items!
 *
 * The other important thing about binary search trees is that they are similar
 * to linked lists in the sense that you only need to update the immediately
 * surrounding items when adding or removing a value.
